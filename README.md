# Face-Recognition-OpenCV

A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. 
There are multiple methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected facial features from given image with faces within a database. 
It is also described as a Biometric Artificial Intelligence based application[citation needed] that can uniquely identify a person by analyzing patterns based on the person's facial textures and shape.

This module uses Hog(Histogram if Oriented Gradients) features to Detect an image of a person.
It also includes Face Recognition using the face_recognition package.
I have finally shown some Face Landmarks using the same module.
